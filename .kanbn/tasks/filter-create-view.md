# Filter Create & View

Implement a filter mechanism, that will allow users to filter the displayed posts by :

- categories
- created posts (my posts?)
- liked posts (Posts that have my likes/dislikes?)

The last two are only available for registered users and must refer to the logged in user.

  - Use struct if there is no access to table
  - Build the struct to match proposed table attributes
